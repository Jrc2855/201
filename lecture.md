## Terminal Commands

* folder is the same thing as a directory.

* Faster use of our operating system, when performing file structure operations.
    * Creating files, creating folders, moving folders:
* 'pwd',  'tree', 'touch', 'ls'.
    * pwd = print working directory. Basically a "here you are" like on a map.
    * tree = prints out all of the files/ folders and their contents in your entire directory.
    * touch = creates a file, located at your working directory. 
    * ls = prints files only in your current directory, if you use ls -l it shows everything in a long list, rather than displaying everything horizontally.
* 'cd', 'mkdir', 'rm', 'cp', 'mv'
    * cd = change directory.
    * mkdir = make directory. 
    * rm = removes a file/ folder. Completely destroys the folder. 
    * rm -r = removes a directory along with all of its contents.
    * cp = Copies a file/ folder.
    * mv = move a file. In the terminal input it in this way, command: file-name: path you want the file moved to. Can also be used to rename a file. 
* git
